## PHP Lecture 01: Introduction and Basics

---
### Introduction to PHP
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Initially created as "Personal Home Page," it evolved to handle dynamic web content, database interaction, and more. PHP is embedded directly into HTML, making it highly efficient for building web applications.

PHP scripts are executed on the server, and the result is returned to the client as plain HTML. It is platform-independent, meaning PHP code can run on different operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Why Use PHP?
- **Easy to Learn**: PHP has a simple syntax and is easy for beginners to pick up.
- **Open-Source**: Free to use with a large community and extensive resources.
- **Cross-Platform**: PHP works on multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- **Database Integration**: Excellent support for databases like MySQL.
- **Scalability**: PHP is used by websites ranging from small personal blogs to large enterprise systems.

### Three-Tier Web-Based Application Architecture
A three-tier architecture separates the application into three layers to enhance modularity and scalability.

1. **Presentation Layer (Client-Side)**:  
   This layer includes the user interface components that interact with users, typically consisting of HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript. It displays content to the user and sends requests to the server.

2. **Business Logic Layer (Server-Side)**:  
   This is the core functionality of the application, where the server-side code (like PHP) processes user inputs, handles requests, performs calculations, and interacts with the database. It acts as the intermediary between the client and the database.

3. **Data Layer (Database)**:  
   This layer stores and retrieves data, often using a database like MySQL. The server-side layer interacts with the database to fetch, update, or delete data, based on user interactions.

### Client-Side Scripting vs. Server-Side Scripting

| **Client-Side Scripting**              | **Server-Side Scripting**              |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Code is executed on the user's browser | Code is executed on the web server     |
| Limited access to system resources     | Full access to server-side resources   |
| Examples: HTML, CSS, JavaScript        | Examples: PHP, ASP.NET, Node.js        |
| No server communication required       | Requires server communication          |
| Visible to the user (can be inspected) | Hidden from the user for security      |

**Summary**: Client-side scripting is used for UI interactions and immediate feedback, while server-side scripting like PHP is used to manage data and complex logic.

### PHP Basics

#### PHP Syntax
PHP code is written within special tags `<?php ... ?>` embedded inside HTML. Everything within these tags is processed by the PHP engine on the server.

```php
<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

- **Echo**: Outputs text to the screen. Example: `echo "Hello, World!";`.
- **Comments**:  
  - Single-line: `// Comment`
  - Multi-line: `/* Multi-line Comment */`

### Variables, Data Types, Operators, and Constants

#### Variables
In PHP, variables are declared with a `$` symbol followed by the variable name. PHP is dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to declare the type of the variable explicitly.

Example:
```php
<?php
  $name = "John";
  $age = 25;
?>
```

- Variables must start with a letter or underscore.
- Variables are case-sensitive.

#### Data Types
PHP supports several data types, including:
- **String**: A sequence of characters (e.g., `"Hello"`).
- **Integer**: Whole numbers (e.g., `10`).
- **Float**: Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`).
- **Boolean**: `true` or `false`.
- **Array**: An ordered collection of values.
- **Object**: An instance of a class.

Example:
```php
<?php
  $name = "PHP";
  $version = 8.1; // Float
  $isPHPFun = true; // Boolean
?>
```

Here’s the plain text version of the operators section:

---

**Operators**

PHP supports various operators to perform operations on variables:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`  
  Example: `$sum = 5 + 10;`
  
- **Assignment Operators**: 
	- =, +=, -=, *=, /=  
- **Comparison Operators**: `(==, !=, ===, !==, >, <, >=, <= )`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`  
  Example: `if ($a > 0 && $b > 0) { echo "Both are positive."; }`

---
#### Constants
Constants are similar to variables, except they cannot be changed after they are defined. They are defined using the `define()` function or `const` keyword.

Example:
```php
<?php
  define("SITE_NAME", "MyWebsite");
  const PI = 3.14;
?>
```
- **SITE_NAME** and **PI** are constants and cannot be modified once declared.

### Example of a Simple PHP Program
Here’s a simple PHP program that takes user input (through an HTML form) and processes it using PHP:

**HTML Form:**
```html
<form action="welcome.php" method="post">
  Name: <input type="text" name="name">
  Age: <input type="text" name="age">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```

**PHP Script (welcome.php):**
```php
<?php
  $name = $_POST['name'];
  $age = $_POST['age'];
  echo "Welcome, $name. You are $age years old.";
?>
```

This example shows how PHP handles form data using the `$_POST` superglobal array.

### Setting Up a PHP Development Environment
To run PHP code on your local machine, you need to set up a server environment:

1. **Install XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP**: These bundles include Apache (web server), PHP, and MySQL.
2. **Write PHP files**: Save your PHP scripts in the server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
3. **Access via browser**: Type `http://localhost/yourfile.php` in your browser to run the PHP script.

### PHP Superglobal Variables (Short Version)

Superglobals in PHP are built-in variables accessible anywhere in the script, without needing to declare them as `global`.

1. **`$_GET`**  
   Retrieves data sent via URL query parameters.
   ```php
   $name = $_GET['name'];
   ```

2. **`$_POST`**  
   Collects data sent via HTTP POST method (forms).
   ```php
   $name = $_POST['name'];
   ```

3. **`$_REQUEST`**  
   Accesses data from `$_GET`, `$_POST`, and `$_COOKIE`.
   ```php
   $name = $_REQUEST['name'];
   ```

4. **`$_SERVER`**  
   Contains server and request information.
   ```php
   echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; // Script name
   ```

5. **`$_SESSION`**  
   Stores session data across different pages.
   ```php
   session_start();
   $_SESSION['user'] = 'John';
   ```

6. **`$_COOKIE`**  
   Stores data in the user’s browser.
   ```php
   setcookie('user', 'John', time() + 86400);
   ```

7. **`$_FILES`**  
   Handles file uploads.
   ```php
   move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], "uploads/" . $_FILES['file']['name']);
   ```

8. **`$_ENV`**  
   Accesses environment variables.
   ```php
   echo $_ENV['SERVER_SOFTWARE'];
   ```

9. **`$GLOBALS`**  
   Accesses global variables inside functions.
   ```php
   global $x;
   ```


### Functions and type conversions

$a = '32'; ---> string
settype($a,"integer")   ---->a becomes integer
