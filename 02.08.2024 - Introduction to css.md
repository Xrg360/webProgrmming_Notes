## Introduction to CSS

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout and appearance of web pages, making them visually appealing and user-friendly.

### Why Use CSS?

1. **Separation of Content and Presentation**: HTML is used for content structure, while CSS is used for styling. This separation improves maintainability and accessibility.
2. **Consistency**: CSS allows for consistent styling across multiple web pages, ensuring a uniform look and feel.
3. **Efficiency**: By linking a single CSS file to multiple HTML files, changes can be applied site-wide, reducing redundancy and saving time.

### Basic Syntax

CSS uses a rule-based syntax where selectors define which HTML elements the styles apply to, and declarations define the styles themselves.

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

**Example:**

```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

### Selectors

Selectors are used to target HTML elements.

1. **Element Selector**: Targets all instances of an element.
   ```css
   p {
     color: red;
   }
   ```
2. **Class Selector**: Targets elements with a specific class.
   ```css
   .class-name {
     font-style: italic;
   }
   ```
3. **ID Selector**: Targets an element with a specific ID.
   ```css
   #id-name {
     text-align: center;
   }
   ```
4. **Attribute Selector**: Targets elements with a specific attribute.
   ```css
   [type="text"] {
     border: 1px solid black;
   }
   ```

### Box Model

The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree and consists of:

1. **Content**: The actual content of the element.
2. **Padding**: Space between the content and the border.
3. **Border**: Surrounds the padding (if any) and content.
4. **Margin**: Space outside the border.

### Example Box Model Properties

```css
div {
  width: 300px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  margin: 15px;
}
```

### CSS Units

Common units in CSS include:

- **px (pixels)**: Absolute unit.
- **em**: Relative to the font-size of the element.
- **rem**: Relative to the font-size of the root element.
- **% (percentage)**: Relative to the parent element.

### Responsive Design

CSS enables responsive web design, which ensures web pages look good on all devices.

1. **Media Queries**: Apply styles based on device characteristics.
   ```css
   @media (max-width: 600px) {
     body {
       background-color: lightgreen;
     }
   }
   ```
2. **Flexbox**: Layout model for flexible and responsive design.
3. **Grid**: Two-dimensional layout system for complex designs.

### Conclusion

CSS is a powerful tool for web developers to create visually appealing and responsive web pages. By mastering CSS, you can control the look and feel of your websites, enhancing the user experience.
